## How to Play

The Memory Game is a simple game where you need to find matching pairs of cards. Here's how to play:

1. Click on a card to reveal its symbol.
2. Click on another card to reveal its symbol.
3. If the symbols on the two cards match, they will remain face up.
4. If the symbols on the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back face down.
5. Continue flipping cards and trying to find matching pairs until all cards are matched.

## Features

- Timer: The game includes a timer that keeps track of the time it takes you to complete the game.
- Score: The game keeps track of your score based on the number of moves you make.
- Restart: You can restart the game at any time by clicking on the restart button.
